## PN:OI 

Node module for creative computations

## Scope 

This library is created to supplement the missing "feaures" of raw, algorythmic computation like: 

* Friction
* Boredom
* Will
* Ego 
...

Imagination is the window for the creative mind. If we give a machine imagination we can sit back an enjoy its creativity.
